# Libft

In this project, you'll be creating your first library in C. In fact, the idea is to reproduce the behaviour of some of the functions of the C standard library, but there's also additional ones.  
Once done with the project, you can add any function you want to enrich your library.  
As the first Ecole 42's project, this is your first contact with a lot of concepts. But don't sweat it, the piscine was a nice warming to this - maybe you already did some of these functions back then, depending on the list you stopped.  

Either way, I'll list some interesting points about this project and how it can get you warmed up for your future trajectory at 42!  


Below, a summary of the functions, grouped by their purposes.  

## Functions to deal with memory  
In this one, you find functions to allocate memory, to move memory,  
to copy the memory from one place to another, to compare memory and  
to find a specific character in a given memory.  
- ft_memccpy  
- ft_memchr  
- ft_memcmp  
- ft_memcpy  
- ft_memmove  
- ft_memset  
- ft_calloc  
- ft_bzero  

## Functions to deal with strings  
These are functions to parse and manipulate strings. With them, you can  
find a specific character in a given string, you can duplicate a string,  
you can concatenate a string to another, copy a piece of the string to  
another, you can count the string's length, you can compare the strings,  
you can extract a substring from the given string, you can trim a string  
or split a given string into multiply strings.  
- ft_strchr  
- ft_strdup  
- ft_strjoin  
- ft_strcat  
- ft_strlcpy  
- ft_strlen  
- ft_strmapi  
- ft_strncmp  
- ft_strnstr  
- ft_strrchr  
- ft_strtrim  
- ft_substr  
- ft_split  

## Functions to deal with characters and numbers  
- ft_atoi  
- ft_count_unsign  
- ft_isalnum  
- ft_isalpha  
- ft_isascii  
- ft_isdigit  
- ft_isprint  
- ft_itoa  
- ft_itohex  
- ft_tolower  
- ft_toupper  

## Functions to deal with lists (bonus)  
- ft_lstadd_back  
- ft_lstadd_front  
- ft_lstclear  
- ft_lstdelone  
- ft_lstiter  
- ft_lstlast  
- ft_lstmap  
- ft_lstnew  
- ft_lstsize  

## Functions to print the argument in the output  
- ft_putchar_fd  
- ft_putendl_fd  
- ft_putnbr_fd  
- ft_putnbr_unsig  
- ft_putstr_fd
