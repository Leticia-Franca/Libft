# Libft

In this project, you'll be creating your first library in C. The idea is to reproduce the behaviour of some functions of the C standard library, but there's also additional ones.  
Once done with this, you can add any function you want to enrich your library.  
As the opening Ecole 42's project, this may be your first contact with a lot of concepts. It can definitely be intimidating when you first open the pdf and stare at that big list of functions to code, but hey, Don't sweat it! The piscine/ was a nice warming - maybe you already did some of these functions back then, depending on the list you stopped.  
What you need to keep in mind is: **this is the first brick to build your forte**  
 

Either way, let's sum up this so you can level up rest assured (pesquisar essa expressao):

Below, a summary of the functions, grouped by their purposes.  

## Functions to deal with memory  
In this one, you find functions to allocate memory, to move memory,  
to copy the memory from one place to another, to compare memory and  
to find a specific character in a given memory.  
- ft_memccpy  
- ft_memchr  
- ft_memcmp  
- ft_memcpy  
- ft_memmove  
- ft_memset  
- ft_calloc  
- ft_bzero  

## Functions to deal with strings  
These are functions to parse and manipulate strings. With them, you can  
find a specific character in a given string, you can duplicate a string,  
you can concatenate a string to another, copy a piece of the string to  
another, you can count the string's length, you can compare the strings,  
you can extract a substring from the given string, you can trim a string  
or split a given string into multiply strings.  
- ft_strchr  
- ft_strdup  
- ft_strjoin  
- ft_strcat  
- ft_strlcpy  
- ft_strlen  
- ft_strmapi  
- ft_strncmp  
- ft_strnstr  
- ft_strrchr  
- ft_strtrim  
- ft_substr  
- ft_split  

## Functions to deal with characters and numbers  
- ft_atoi  
- ft_count_unsign  
- ft_isalnum  
- ft_isalpha  
- ft_isascii  
- ft_isdigit  
- ft_isprint  
- ft_itoa  
- ft_itohex  
- ft_tolower  
- ft_toupper  

## Functions to deal with lists (bonus)  
- ft_lstadd_back  
- ft_lstadd_front  
- ft_lstclear  
- ft_lstdelone  
- ft_lstiter  
- ft_lstlast  
- ft_lstmap  
- ft_lstnew  
- ft_lstsize  

## Functions to print the argument in the output  
- ft_putchar_fd  
- ft_putendl_fd  
- ft_putnbr_fd  
- ft_putnbr_unsig  
- ft_putstr_fd
